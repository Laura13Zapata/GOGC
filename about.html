    <h1>About Us!</h1>
    <h2>Empowering girls has never been more important </h2>
    <p>The idea beind Connecting Our Girls simply came by looking at our world and seeing the lack of opportunity given to women around the world. When starting this website, our goal was to make sure that girls and women around the US are given equal opportunity and resources to get reach the dreams and jobs they've always wanted.</p>
    <p> STEM is one the fields that had been ignored by women because either we're too afraid or not guided in that direction. We're here to change that for all women! As a young women I've always wanted to be able to express myself and find myself.. sometimes its hard finding good resoruces to do those things. When creating this website thats the idea we had in mind: creating resources for everyone around the world to be able to connect to bigger opportunites. Women deserve more, women need to be heard, and women must elevate and follow their dreams. Getting our Girls connected is what we are for!<p>
