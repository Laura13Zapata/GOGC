    <h1>About Us!</h1>
    <h2>Empowering girls has never been more important </h2>
    <p>The idea beind Connecting Our Girls simply came by looking at our world and seeing the lack of opportunity given to women around the world. When starting this website, our goal was to make sure that girls and women around the US are given equal opportunity and resources to get reach the dreams and jobs they've always wanted </p>
    <p> STEM is one the fields that had been ignored by women because either we're too afraid or not guided in that direction. We're here to change that for all women!<p>
